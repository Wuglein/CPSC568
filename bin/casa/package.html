The casa package is the main package for CASA (Collaborative Agent System 
Architecture), which is an infrastructure for agent based systems.

<P>See <a href="doc-files/index.html" target="CASA">CASA overview documentation</a>.</P>

The important classes if you interested in implementing agents are:
<ul>
<li> {@link casa.Agent} a persistent, full-functioning agent.  You should inherit
     from this class when building most agents.
<li> {@link casa.ML} An interface containing constant strings used in MLMesssage.
<li> {@link casa.MLMessage} Base class for {@link casa.XMLMessage}
     and {@link casa.KQMLMessage}.  Contains the most basic, necessary functions
     for a markup message in the CASA package.  Also contains functionality for
     interfacing with XML and KQML messages. That is, the field markupLanguage
     determines the type of message (XML/KQML) to be returned by the
     getNewMLMessage function.  This is basically a key/value map where
     the keys represent the message field names, and the values represent
     the corresponding values.
<li> {@link casa.URLDescriptor} represents URL strings are of the form
     casa://user@host:port/dir/file#fragment?key=value&key=value.  Agent
     communication and messages use URLs to identify all agents.
<li> {@link casa.PerformDescriptor} A simple description consisting of key/value pairs.
     It is an extension of {@link java.util.TreeMap} with a {@link casa.Status} properties added.
     PerformDescriptor is usually used to return information from an agent processing
     a message.  The policies call callback methods to allow the agent to process
     the message appropriately (if at all), and use the information returned in
     the PerformDescriptor to modify behaviour.  For example, if a <em>reply</em>
     is normally called for, the type of the reply will be modified depending on
     the Status object in the returned PerformDescriptor, but the key/value pairs
     always override whatever the "normative" key/value pairs in any reply
     message.
<li> {@link casa.Status} A simple combination of an status <em>int</em> and a 
     text description <em>String</em> used to return status values from many
     methods.  The value part's meaning is taken to be:
     <ul>
     <li>&lt;0: error (an explanation is expected int String description part)
     <li>0: success
     <li>&gt;0: warning (a qualified success, usually with some explanation)
     </ul>
</ul>
