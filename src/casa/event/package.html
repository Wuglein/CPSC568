Contains classes that implement Events (see {@link casa.event.Event}),
which are used to describe dependencies (including time expiry or time
intervals) among things like social commitments and deferred code.
<p>
The Event interface describes an interrupt style event. Each event must have
access to a thread to monitor or wait for the event to occur. When it does,
it queues the event to it's agent's event queue, and this agent is responsible
for eventually executing its {@link casa.event.Event#fireEvent()} method which informs 
all observers of the event.  The agents queue fits into the grand scheme of things
as follows:

<p>
All events have an event type (a string that should be in the agent's ontology), 
which may be used by the event
observers to distinguish between multiple events it is observing.
<p>
If an observer wishes to be informed of the occurrence of the event, it must
implement the {@link casa.event.EventObserver} interface. The observer object must also
be passed on to {@link casa.event.Event#addEventObserver(EventObserver)}. If the observer is
added before {@link casa.event.Event#start()} is called, it is guaranteed to be informed of
the event's occurrence. If not, there is no guarantee. When the event occurs,
{@link casa.event.EventObserver#notifyEventOccurred(String,Event,Object)} is called for all
registered observers.
